# The author of xscreensaver is on a holy battle with debian package maintainers
# and added some insane pop-up eons ago that tells users to build from source.
#
# Since the whole purpose of our system is to make it easier for user to build swgemu
# from source, the last thing we need is them panicking about the stupid screen saver
# in a VM!
# 
# We don't need it and we don't need users upset or worried about it either.
