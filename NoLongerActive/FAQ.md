### How do I enable an admin account?
#### *Deprecated in emuyoda*
- In MySQL Workbench, go to: 
- Schemata -> swgemu -> accounts -> admin_level -> change 0 to 15 -> Apply change -> Execute ->
- Then do build config again.
- Next toon created on that account will be admin.

### How do I enable the admin commands?
To enable these features in the client you will need to edit the user.cfg file in the c:\SWGEMU folder to add these 4 lines:
 > [ClientGame]  
 > 0fd345d9 = true  
 > [ClientUserInterface]  
 > debugExamine=1  
 
If the user.cfg file doesnâ€™t exist, simply copy swgemu.cfg and rename it as user.cfg. Then, replace the contents of the new user.cfg with the contents of the table above.

You might also need to add a line in swgemu.cfg to tell the client to use the new user.cfg file:
> .include "swgemu_login.cfg"  
> .include "swgemu_live.cfg"  
> .include "swgemu_preload.cfg"  
> .include "options.cfg"  
> .include "user.cfg"      <-- THIS LINE MIGHT BE MISSING or Commented out  

Once the config files are done, totally shut down your client (if running) and restart it. 

### How do I  enable other planets?
#### *Deprecated in emuyoda*
Open the 'MMOCoreORB/bin/conf/config.lua' and navigate to the ZonesEnabled section and you will see a list off all the planets. Most are commented out using '--' as a prefix. Simply remove that prefix from the planets you wish to enable. 
Do config build of server.

### HOW TO: Run Unit Tests
SWGEmu has a growing number of unit tests that validate functionality automatically.
Jenkins runs all unit tests as part of the verification build. A commit that breaks a unit test will not be merged into the baseline.
Before pushing changes, you should always run the unit tests in your development environment. 

Run All Unit Tests
> cd /home/!username/workspace/MMOCoreORB/bin  
> ./core3 runUnitTests

Run Specific Unit Tests
>  cd /home/!username/workspace/MMOCoreORB/bin  
> ./core3 runUnitTests --gtest_filter=<FILTERSTRING>

where <FILTERSTRING> is the name of a specific test as defined in the TEST_F call. Wildcards may be used. For example --gtest_filter=LuaMobile* runs all tests in LuaMobileTest.cpp
